Suppose you had a look at the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021" target="_blank">2021 stack overflow developer survey results</a>.

In that case, you may see that **PostgreSQL**, or *Postgres* for short, is now the second most loved **database**.

I personally love Postgres as well. Hence, time to dedicate an article on **how to set up PostgreSQL on a Mac**.

In this tutorial you will learn to **install Postgres** on a Macintosh using **Homebrew**, plus we will explore the database a bit ðŸ‘€.

If you haven't used Homebrew before, check out my article on [using Homebrew](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/homebrew-one-package-manager-to-rule-them-all/).

## How to install Postgres with Homebrew

The first thing we want to do is to **install Postgres DB**.

Before running any install command in Homebrew, it's good to ensure your installation is up to date.

```bash
brew update
```

Now is the time; to install PostgreSQL run this command:

```bash
brew install postgresql
```

Once the installation is finished, you should see this output line amongst some other information:

```bash
This formula has created a default database cluster with:
  initdb --locale=C -E UTF-8 /opt/homebrew/var/postgres
```

That means the Postgres DB is installed and you are set!

## Start & Manage a Postgres database

To **start the database**, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
brew services start postgresql
```

And to **stop the Postgres database** from running:

```bash
brew services stop postgresql
```

Once the DB is up and running, we want to create a **root user** to log in and interact with the database.

```bash
psql postgres
```

This will log you into the Postgres server.

From here, you can create a new user with a password.

```bash
CREATE ROLE chris WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'password';
ALTER ROLE chris CREATEDB;
```

My user's name is `chris`, and my password is super secure as: `password`.

> Note: Use secure passwords, please. This is just a demo setup.

## Connect to PostgreSQL DB

The easiest way to connect to Postgres is via the visual database connection tools.

If you are unsure what client to use: I've written down my [top 5 SQL database clients](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/top-5-mysql-clients-for-mac/).

We'll use [TablePlus](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/top-5-mysql-clients-for-mac/#heading-1-tableplus) to connect to our newly created PostgreSQL DB.

- Open the app, and create a "new connection".
- For the type, you can choose "PostgreSQL".

As for the connection details, you should use:

- User: The one you just created, in my case `chris`.
- Password: The password you set, in my case, `password`.
- Database: This will be `postgres`.

The rest of the **data** should already be set up correctly.

You can test the connection by clicking the "Test" button at the bottom. It should turn everything green.

And that's it. You are now connected to your Postgres database ðŸš€
